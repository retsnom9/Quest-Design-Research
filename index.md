## Introduction
_"Quests are about action that is meaningful to a player on the level of ideas, personal ambitions, benefit to society and/or spiritual authenticity."_   Jeff Howard - Quests: Design, Theory, and History in Games and Narratives (2008).

_“Quests are this place in a video game where game design, gaming and technology all come together.”_   Jeszek Szczepanski - _Building Non-Linear Narratives in Horizon: Zero Dawn_ (GDC 2017).

Whether they are a minor feature of a game or a vital one, quests must be properly developed in order to keep -and, hopefully, reinforce- players' feeling of immersion. An important amount of games tend to have a poor approach to Quest Design, due to a low amount of resources being put into it, which can make the whole product fall flat. Games that invest a high amount of resources in their questing aspect, on the other hand, normally have a noticable success because of it (e.g., _The Witcher 3_).

In this article, we will go through what quests **are**, what quests **must be like** and what they must **transmit**. Even though the information is mostly focused around the RPG genre, it can be useful to design quests for all kinds of games.

## What is a quest?
### Definition of Quest
First things first, we need to define what a quest is. According to Wikipedia, _"A quest or mission is a task that a player-controlled character, "party", or group of characters may complete in order to gain a reward."_

This means that we are able to turn any action our player can perform into a quest, as long as we reward them for it. This definition is not enough, though. In order to approach Quest Design properly, we need to be able to differenciate between _Main Quests_ and _Side Quests_.

### Main Quests vs Side Quests
Most people tend to think that a Main Quest is simply a quest you must complete in order to advance through the game, and a Side Quest an optional mission that you can decide whether or not to fulfill, without it representing any major effect in the core gameplay itself.
The problem with this conception is that if, for example, the storyline of a game bifurcates into distinct quest chains, and you choose the "A" option, it implies not playing a set of quests that you would have had to complete in order to progress through the game if you had decided otherwise.
Similarly, there are some Side Quests that players must complete in order to level up or grind, making them not that "skippable" anymore.

### Definition of Main Quest
According to Dean Razavi, Game Designer for Razbury Games, Main Quests are plot points in our narrative arc, meaning that anything that is not related to the main story of the game can not be considered one.

To expand on the matter, Main Quests normally tell the story of a character -who tends to be the player's-. They can be used to reach points in the narrative arc (Points of Interest) determined by the protagonist’s transformation; often following the [Hero’s Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey) in RPG’s.
Main Quests start at the early stages of the game, introducing the main story, and develop it as the player progresses, showcasing it from beginning to end.

### Definition of Side Quest
Instead of telling the main storyline, Side Quests help to explain, describe and discover the world that surrounds the main character, as well as its inhabitants, while existing out of the main narrative arc.

## Quest Design Pillars
A quest **must...**

**... be meaningful.** The player needs to feel connected to it in some way or another, and be engaged about it. They will invest their time on playing it, whether if it's for 5 minutes or 2 hours. We can't let them down by forcing them into going through something they do not enjoy in order to get to the better content later on.

**... convey a story.** It has to transmit a series of feelings and sensations, to make the previously mentioned connection easier, while narrating the facts that made that one village be what it is today, or explain what happened between these two brothers for them to be fighting to death now.

**... be immersive.** The player is not listening to a story, nor reading one. They are intervening and taking part in it. They must feel as an important piece of the tale, that carries it on and changes the curse of it depending on their decisions. If the players think that they don't take any part in the quest's narration, they won't relate to it nor its characters, and we'll have failed on its design.

## Basic Quest Categories
Quests can normally be casified in 4 different types:

**Kill Quests:** the classical "kill 10 rats" kind of quest.

**Fetch/Gather Quests:** "bring me 5 rat tails" kind of quest.

**Delivery Quests:** bring a package from a Non-Playable Character (NPC) to another. Could be considered as a variant of fetch quests.

**Escort Quests:** Protect an NPC on their way to X place.

## Quest Creation Process
### Concept Creation/Sketching
First of all, you have to know what resources you dispose of. Depending on them (and your game), you can use a narrower quest system, which mostly uses, for example, kill and fetch quests, or a wider one, which can use puzzles, minigames or any other innovative method you can think of in order to solve missions. Having a narrow quest system allows you and your team to easily be in the same page, and create a lot of quests in an agile way, but they will probably get repetitive and, therefore, boring. On the other hand, if your system is too wide and allows for basically anything, the quest creation process will be a lot slower and harder, but quests will be interesting and most likely fun to play. You normally want something in the middle, so that your quest system is dynamic enough to be fast and have all the team members on the same page (programmers and artists also take part when it comes to implement quests, and even writers if your team disposes of them), and allow for freedom and interesting quest design at the same time.

Once you and your team have clear what types of quests you will be creating, you can start creating quest concepts. The best way to do so is by making a lot of them, and then filtering them carefully. Pay special attention to the first ones that come to mind, since they tend to be the most clicheyish ones.

Write, in a couple short sentences, what the concept of the quest would be, followed by what the player should do in order to complete it in a really general way. Here are two examples of initial quest concepts for _The Withcer 3_ done by CD Projekt RED game designers, shown in [Australia's 2015 PAX](https://youtu.be/N-bdlcnXBn8):

_“A tower appeared out of nowhere - Geralt must find out why it happened and get rid of it.”_
_“A fake witcher is giving witchers bad name - Geralt can find out who he is and deal with him.”_

As you can see, even if the concept is simple, it should already be interesting and express a clear and concise idea. This indicates that the quest has potential, and that it will be easy to expand later on.

### Aspects to Keep in Mind in Main Quests
If you have a villain, do not use it to create quests. Use your main character, or hero, instead. Evaluate what scenarios you need in order to produce certain changes in your hero, and then how to use the villain to create those scenarios and draw the story to those Points of Interest, in a way that feels natural.

### Aspects to Keep in Mind in Side Quests
In most Side Quests, you should define well stated rewards. The player should know what they're getting after finishing your quest, so that they can estimate what the effort-payoff difference might be. If you do not state the rewards, or don't specify them a lot, you will be making an agreement with the player. If they enjoy your quest enough, or feel that the reward is fair, there generally won't be any complains. However, if they do not enjoy it, they will feel betrayed, since not only you didn't provide proper content, but you didn't provide an adequate reward to compensate for it either. This can affect their immersion, their initial perception in future quests and, most importantly, their general experience, so we must be really careful with that.


### Hiding Quest types
Kill quests should only serve to teach the basic combat mechanics, if used at all. If they are not used carefully, they get repetitive and tedious. Same thing applies to fetch and delivery quests.

## Introduction
_"Quests are about action that is meaningful to a player on the level of ideas, personal ambitions, benefit to society and/or spiritual authenticity."_  Jeff Howard - Quests: Design, Theory, and History in Games and Narratives (2008).

_“Quests are this place in a video game where game design, gaming and technology all come together.”_ Jeszek Szczepanski - _Building Non-Linear Narratives in Horizon: Zero Dawn_ (GDC 2017).

Whether they are a minor feature of a game or a vital one, quests must be properly developed in order to keep -and, hopefully, reinforce- players' feeling of immersion. Most games tend to have a poor approach to Quest Design, due to a low amount of resources being put into it, which can make the whole product fall flat. Games that invest a high amount of resources in their questing aspect, on the other hand, normally have a noticable success because of it (e.g., _The Witcher 3_).

In this article, we will go through what quests **are**, what quests **must be like** and what they must **transmit**. Even though the information is mostly focused around the RPG genre, this information can be useful to design quests for all kinds of games.

## What is a quest?
### Definition
First things first, we need to define what a quest is. According to Wikipedia, _"A quest or mission is a task that a player-controlled character, "party", or group of characters may complete in order to gain a reward."_

This means that we are able to turn any action our player can perform into a quest, as long as we reward them for it. This definition is not enough, though. In order to approach Quest Design properly, we need to be able to differenciate between _Main Quests_ and _Side Quests_.

### Main Quests vs Side Quests
Most people tend to think that a Main Quest is simply a quest you must complete in order to advance through the game, and a Side Quest an optional mission that you can decide wether or not to fulfill, without it representing any major effect in the core gameplay itself.
The problem with this conception is that if, for example, the storyline of a game bifurcates into distinct quest chains, and you choose the "A" option, it implies not playing a set of quests that you would have had to complete in order to progress through the game if you had decided otherwise.
Similarly, there are some Side Quests that players must complete in order to level up or grind, making them not that "skippable" anymore.

### Definition of Main Quest
According to Dean Razavi, Game Designer for Razbury Games, Main Quests are plot points in our narrative arc, meaning that anything that is not related to the main story of the game can not be considered one.
To expand on the matter, Main Quests normally tell the story of a character -who tends to be the player's-. They can be used to reach points in the narrative arc (Points of Interest) determined by the protagonist’s transformation; often following the [Hero’s Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey) in RPG’s.
Main Quests start at the early stages of the game, introducing the main story, and develop it as the player progresses, showcasing it from beginning to end.

### Definition of Side Quest
Instead of telling the main storyline, Side Quests help to explain, describe and discover the world that surrounds the main character, as well as its inhabitants, while existing out of the main narrative arc.

## Musts
A quest **must...**

**... be meaningful.** The player needs to feel connected to it in some way or another, and be engaged about it. They will invest their time on playing it, whether if it's for 5 minutes or 2 hours. We can not let them down by forcing them to go through something they do not enjoy in order to get to the better content later on.

**... convey a story.** It has to transmit a series of feelings and sensations, to make the previous mentioned connection easier, while narrating the facts that made that one village be what it is today, or explain what happened between these two brothers for them to be fighting to death.

**... be immersive.** The player is not listening to a story, nor reading one. They are intervening and taking part of it. They must feel as an important piece of the tale, that carries it on and changes the curse of it depending on their decisions. If the player thinks that they don't take any part on the quest's narration, they won't relate to it nor its characters, and we'll have failed on its design.

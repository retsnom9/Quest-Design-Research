## Introduction
-Quests are about action that is meaningful to a player on the level of ideas, personal ambitions, benefit to society and/or spiritual authenticity.  _Jeff Howard, Quests: Design, Theory, and History in Games and Narratives (2008)_
-“Quests are this place in a video game where game design, gaming and technology all come together.” -Leszek Szczepanski.

Whether they are a minor feature of a game or a vital one, quests must be properly developed in order to keep -and, hopefuly, reinforce- players' feeling of immersion. Most games tend to have a poor approach to quest design, due to a low amount of resources being put into it, which can make the whole product fall flat. Games that invest a high amount of resources in their questing aspect, however, normally have a noticable success because of it (e.g., _The Witcher 3_).

## Introduction
_"Quests are about action that is meaningful to a player on the level of ideas, personal ambitions, benefit to society and/or spiritual authenticity."_   Jeff Howard - Quests: Design, Theory, and History in Games and Narratives (2008).

_“Quests are this place in a video game where game design, gaming and technology all come together.”_   Jeszek Szczepanski - _Building Non-Linear Narratives in Horizon: Zero Dawn_ (GDC 2017).

Whether they are a minor feature of a game or a vital one, quests must be properly developed in order to keep -and, hopefully, reinforce- players' feeling of immersion. An important amount of games tend to have a poor approach to Quest Design, due to a low amount of resources being put into it, which can make the whole product fall flat. Games that invest a high amount of resources in their questing aspect, on the other hand, normally have a noticable success because of it (e.g., _The Witcher 3_).

In this article, we will go through what quests **are**, what quests **must be like** and what they must **transmit**. Even though the information is mostly focused around the RPG genre, it can be useful to design quests for all kinds of games.

## What is a quest?
### Definition of Quest
First things first, we need to define what a quest is. According to Wikipedia, _"A quest or mission is a task that a player-controlled character, "party", or group of characters may complete in order to gain a reward."_

This means that we are able to turn any action our player can perform into a quest, as long as we reward them for it. This definition is not enough, though. In order to approach Quest Design properly, we need to be able to differenciate between _Main Quests_ and _Side Quests_.

### Main Quests vs Side Quests
Most people tend to think that a Main Quest is simply a quest you must complete in order to advance through the game, and a Side Quest an optional mission that you can decide whether or not to fulfill, without it representing any major effect in the core gameplay itself.
The problem with this conception is that if, for example, the storyline of a game bifurcates into distinct quest chains, and you choose the "A" option, it implies not playing a set of quests that you would have had to complete in order to progress through the game if you had decided otherwise.
Similarly, there are some Side Quests that players must complete in order to level up or grind, making them not that "skippable" anymore.

### Definition of Main Quest
According to Dean Razavi, Game Designer for Razbury Games, Main Quests are plot points in our narrative arc, meaning that anything that is not related to the main story of the game can not be considered one.

To expand on the matter, Main Quests normally tell the story of a character -who tends to be the player's-. They can be used to reach points in the narrative arc (Points of Interest) determined by the protagonist’s transformation; often following the [Hero’s Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey) in RPG’s.
Main Quests start at the early stages of the game, introducing the main story, and develop it as the player progresses, showcasing it from beginning to end.

### Definition of Side Quest
Instead of telling the main storyline, Side Quests help to explain, describe and discover the world that surrounds the main character, as well as its inhabitants, while existing out of the main narrative arc.

## Quest Design Pillars
A quest **must...**

**... be meaningful.** The player needs to feel connected to it in some way or another, and be engaged about it. They will invest their time on playing it, whether if it's for 5 minutes or 2 hours. We can't let them down by forcing them into going through something they do not enjoy in order to get to the better content later on.

**... convey a story.** It has to transmit a series of feelings and sensations, to make the previously mentioned connection easier, while narrating the facts that made that one village be what it is today, or explain what happened between these two brothers for them to be fighting to death now.

**... be immersive.** The player is not listening to a story, nor reading one. They are intervening and taking part in it. They must feel as an important piece of the tale, that carries it on and changes the curse of it depending on their decisions. If the players think that they don't take any part in the quest's narration, they won't relate to it nor its characters, and we'll have failed on its design.

## Basic Quest Categories
Quests can normally be casified in 4 different types:

**Kill Quests:** the classical "kill 10 rats" kind of quest.

**Fetch/Gather Quests:** "bring me 5 rat tails" kind of quest.

**Delivery Quests:** bring a package from a Non-Playable Character (NPC) to another. Could be considered as a variant of fetch quests.

**Escort Quests:** Protect an NPC on their way to X place.

## Quest Creation Process
### Concept Creation/Sketching
First of all, you have to know what resources you dispose of. Depending on them (and your game), you can use a narrower quest system, which mostly uses, for example, kill and fetch quests, or a wider one, which can use puzzles, minigames or any other innovative method you can think of in order to solve missions. Having a narrow quest system allows you and your team to easily be in the same page, and create a lot of quests in an agile way, but they will probably get repetitive and, therefore, boring. On the other hand, if your system is too wide and allows for basically anything, the quest creation process will be a lot slower and harder, but quests will be interesting and most likely fun to play. You normally want something in the middle, so that your quest system is dynamic enough to be fast and have all the team members on the same page (programmers and artists also take part when it comes to implement quests, and even writers if your team disposes of them), and allow for design freedom and interesting quest concepts at the same time.

Once you and your team have clear what types of quests you will be creating, you can start making quest concepts. The best way to do so is by writing down a lot of them, and then filtering them carefully. Pay special attention to the first ones that come to mind, since they tend to be the most cliche ones.

Write, in a couple short sentences, what the concept of the quest would be, followed by what the player should do in order to complete it in a really general way. Here are two examples of initial quest concepts for _The Withcer 3_ done by CD Projekt RED game designers, shown in [Australia's 2015 PAX](https://youtu.be/N-bdlcnXBn8):

_“A tower appeared out of nowhere - Geralt must find out why it happened and get rid of it.”_

_“A fake witcher is giving witchers bad name - Geralt can find out who he is and deal with him.”_

As you can see, even if the concept is simple, it should already be interesting and express a clear and concise idea. This indicates that the quest has potential, and that it will be easy to expand later on.

### Hiding Quest types
Once the concept is clear, you can start thinking what quest/s you will build around it, and their types. Avoid repeating yourself. Kill quests should only serve to teach the basic combat mechanics, if used at all. If they are not used carefully, they get repetitive and tedious. Same thing applies to fetch and delivery quests. Make the best out of your brain and imagination, and think about the content you want your player to experience.

As an example, main quests can just direct the player from one place to another. We always need to keep in mind that they will stumble with our content just by walking through the world we created, if it's wisely placed. There is no need to tell your player to kill 10 rats. Instead, hide it. Make them dive into the sewers, seeking for the villain's den, and they will be forced to fight rats as a result.

### Aspects to Keep in Mind in Main Quests
**Story is king in main quests.** Always keep it in mind when designing them. Main Quests have to properly express to the player how their character (and, therefore, the story that surrounds them) changes during the transcurse of the game, and how that affects the entire scene.


If you have a villain, do not use it to create quests. **Use your main character, or hero, instead.** Evaluate what scenarios you need in order to produce certain changes in your hero, and then how to use the villain to create those scenarios and draw the story to those Points of Interest, in a way that feels natural. This is why the villain is a powerful tool, and its proper use will tend to result in a stronger narrative.

If you want to branch a quest, without it modifying the whole story development, **make the different paths meet at the next Point of Interest in some way.** To make the player percieve their decision as meaningful, you can use further references to their choice of path later in the story, and even modify the ending of your game based on their choices. With that, we can avoid making incredibly complex story developement options, with mutliple and completely different branches, which can take a lot of time and resources we may or may not dispose of. This can also apply to Side Quests, but smaller Side Quests can have two or more distinct approaches at the same time, without having any point in common, while not requiring that big of a cost.

### Aspects to Keep in Mind in Side Quests
In most Side Quests, you should **define well stated rewards.** The player should know what they're getting after finishing your quest, so that they can estimate what the effort-payoff difference might be. If you do not state the rewards, or don't specify them a lot, you will be making an agreement with the player. If they enjoy your quest, and feel that the reward is fair, there won't be any complains. However, if they do not enjoy it, or if they consider the reward not valuable enough to compensate for their actions, they will feel betrayed, since not only they won't have been provided with proper content, but they won't have recieved an adequate reward to "compensate" for it either. This can affect their immersion, their initial perception in future quests and, most importantly, their general experience, so we must be really careful with that.

**Be open about quest givers.** NPC's are not the only ones who can provide missions. A note on the floor, a ring dropped by a skeleton or even your main character driven by curiosity upon encountering a mysterious scenario can be perfect quest starters.

**Don't assume players will only accept quests they are highly interested in.** Due to a psychological aspect, named [Endowment Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect), which is highly related with our [Loss Aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion), humans give a considerably higher amount of value to things once they own them. After being presented with a mission, our brain will associate it with ownership, and we will be hesitant towards not accepting it. This might seem needless to say, but keeping this in mind, try to make every quest appealing and interesting for any player.

Consider creating **confronting quests that create a conflict players must solve by themselves.** For example, if a poor farmer is asking for the player to smuggle a chest full of medicines, in exchange for his last savings, in order to help his ill daughter, but the player encounters two emaciated and unhealthy orphenage kids begging for food, we'll have forced a difficult decision that must be made. Try to keep the difference between rewards ambiguous. It can purely involve personal satisfaction, or it can encourage greed, by adding some juicy extra loot or gold to the mixture, so that the player has to think about who to help and who to "betray", therefore stablishing a connection with the situation and the characters involved in it.

**Use your world to simulate life and transmit its story towards the player.** As an example, in the MMORPG _NosTale_, there is a quest chain in which you have to kill some non-human miners for certain reasons. While fighting against them, they start screaming and questioning your actions, and the players start asking themselves if what they are doing is entirely right. Later on, when the player's character decides not to take part on the slaughter anymore, they will most likely be on the same page, because they have been questioned by the world's characters. Stablishing this kind of bonds between our players and the main character is the main objective we should be aiming for, since it results in an extremely pleasent experience for them.

**Be conciouis about timing.** You do not only need to be aware of where you are going to present your Side Quests, but also when. If the player is at one of the final in-game locations, and they have to go battle against the main boss in order to save the world from an inevitable destruction, you might not want to have an NPC asking for them to collect flowers. You also need to think about short termed quests. If, for instance, the player stumbles across a village that is being attacked by bandits, and one of the villagers asks them for help, the player will probably still be able to walk away and come back in-game weeks later, with the village conveniently still being attacked. To prevent this kind of nonsenses, you might want to consider making it a dungeon instead, or actually burning the village down if the player ignores it for too long, just so that they see that their decisions and actions are taken in account.
